# 🌙 Kavi — A Digital Poetry Gallery

**Kavi** is a minimalist, elegant poetry website — crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Each poem lives in its own text file inside the `/file` folder, and appears beautifully on the site with a dark, cosmic aesthetic.

> _“Words are stars — some burn quietly, others shape galaxies.”_
